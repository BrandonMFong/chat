* Protocol I am planning to use is SIP or SIMPLE. Realized it may be nice for me to learn an industry standard as opposed to making my own. First pass will not implement the entire protocol, will use the spec as inspiration until I get a robust demo
* Decided to isolate the `Socket` class. May be a good idea to pluck this work out into its own library
* Each socket connection will have their own dedicated thread that polls the `recv` call.  This allows us to concurrently handle incoming data from multiple correspondents
* Each socket connection will have an agent representing the remote user on the other end. Having an agent seems to be the best way to id a user by the socket connection. I view an agent like a lawyer representing a client.
* I was using while loops to poll events like ui changes, incoming packets, etc. However, I make it efficient. The loops would constantly loop without any sort of waiting on an event. This made my computer overheat put the cpu usage up to 300% percent. To overcome this, I used my BFLock objects to do a wait/release on the loops/events. This reduced the cpu usage to 5% lol
* Encryption is an interesting task. After implementating encryption I think I can be proud of this project. There are different ways according to gemini: symmetric keys using secure key exchange or ratchet tree. I have never heard of ratchet tree. Sounds interesting
* Working forward with encryption, I will be doing the hybrid encryption from this post: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/204300
